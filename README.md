# power-timeseries

This directory showcases my use of power timeseries to make predictions
using real life data. In consumption_prediction.ipynb I examine the total power
production of Germany over an 8 year period, using the available data to
predict future power consumption.
In predict_now.ipynb the predicted consumption of the next 48 h is displayed usually updated every day.
