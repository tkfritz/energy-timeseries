# Power time-series

This directory showcases my use of power time-series
using real life data.

In consumption_prediction.ipynb I examine and model the total power
production of Germany over an 8 year period. For modelling I use mainly Season-Trend decomposition using LOESS for multiple seasonalities (MSTL).

In predict_now.ipynb the predicted consumption of the next 48 h is displayed usually updated every day.
